## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a simple multi-screen game structure using a state-based approach. Inspired by Life is Strange, this interactive story lets players make choices that branch the narrative. Every decision affects your karma, leading to different endings.This game includes a start screen, an instructions screen with a back button, a basic game screen, and win/lose outcome screens. Player choices affect a tracked stat, karma, which determines the ending.
